                            One of our key focus areas is Social Emotional Learning (in partnership with a US Youth Leadership organization: “Growing Leaders”), mentoring, and leadership development.

We provide genuinely caring support for families, and host monthly Parenting Peer Groups (PPGs), which are gatherings (online/virtual if in-person is not possible) of small groups of parents to provide moral support and academic support to one another.
